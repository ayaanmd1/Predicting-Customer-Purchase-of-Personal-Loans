# Predicting Customer Purchase of Personal Loans

# Introduction 
Thera Bank, the subject of this case, is a bank with a sizable customer base. The majority of these clients are liability clients (depositors), with deposits ranging in amount. Asset customers make up a very tiny portion of the bank's customer base, and the bank is interested in rapidly growing this group to attract more loan business and, as a result, increase revenue through interest.

the cost of borrowing. The management is particularly interested in finding ways to turn its liability customers into personal loan customers while keeping them as deposits. The bank executed a campaign for liability customers last year that had a successful conversion rate of over 9%. This has inspired the retail marketing department to create programs to enhance sales through better focused marketing.

# Problem statement 
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer purchases of personal loans. By leveraging supervised learning techniques, we aim to create a reliable and efficient solution that will assist financial institutions in identifying potential customers who are more likely to apply and acquire personal loans.

The current challenge faced by financial institutions is the inability to effectively target customers for personal loan offers. Traditional marketing strategies often result in a low conversion rate and a significant waste of resources. By predicting customer purchase behavior, we can optimize marketing efforts, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction by delivering personalized loan offers to individuals who are most likely to be interested and eligible.

To address this problem, we will gather historical data from the financial institution, which includes relevant customer attributes such as demographics, income, employment status, credit history, and previous loan application details. This dataset will serve as the training data for the supervised learning algorithms.

The project will involve the following key steps:

Data Collection: Obtain a comprehensive dataset from the financial institution, including customer attributes and loan application outcomes.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and performing feature engineering if necessary.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that strongly correlate with customer purchase of personal loans, using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance ranking.

Model Selection: Evaluate and select appropriate supervised learning algorithms for classification, considering factors such as interpretability, accuracy, and scalability.

Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected models using the prepared dataset, employing techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. Evaluate the models using suitable evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Model Deployment: Deploy the chosen model to predict customer purchase behavior in real-time. Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate loan offer decision-making.

Monitoring and Iteration: Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed model, gather feedback from users and stakeholders, and iterate on the model to further enhance accuracy and predictive power.

By accurately predicting customer purchase of personal loans, financial institutions can streamline their marketing campaigns, allocate resources more efficiently, and improve customer satisfaction. This project will provide actionable insights to drive business growth and enable informed decision-making in loan offer targeting.
